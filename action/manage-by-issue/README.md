# Manage by Issue

Manage contributor vouch status via issue comments. When a collaborator
with sufficient permissions comments `vouch` on an issue, the issue author
is added to the vouched contributors list. When they comment `denounce`,
the user is denounced. When they comment `unvouch`, the user is removed
from the list entirely. The trigger keywords and required permission
levels are configurable.

## Usage

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

## Comment Syntax

Comments from collaborators with sufficient permissions are matched:

- **`vouch`** — vouches for the issue author (customizable via `vouch-keyword`)
- **`vouch @user`** — vouches for a specific user
- **`vouch <reason>`** — vouches for the issue author with a reason
- **`vouch @user <reason>`** — vouches for a specific user with a reason
- **`denounce`** — denounces the issue author (customizable via `denounce-keyword`)
- **`denounce @user`** — denounces a specific user
- **`denounce <reason>`** — denounces the issue author with a reason
- **`denounce @user <reason>`** — denounces a specific user with a reason
- **`unvouch`** — removes the issue author (customizable via `unvouch-keyword`)
- **`unvouch @user`** — removes a specific user

## Commit Behavior

When `dry-run` is `"false"`, the action commits and pushes any changes
to the VOUCHED file automatically. The caller must check out the
repository before using this action.

When `pull-request` is `"true"`, the action creates a new branch and
opens a pull request instead of pushing directly to the default branch.
This requires `pull-requests: write` permission.
